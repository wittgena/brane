"""Protocol-version registry and comparison helpers.

Date-string protocol revisions happen to sort lexicographically, but versions
are an enumerated set, not an ordered scalar: future identifiers are not
guaranteed to be date-shaped, and unrecognized peer strings must compare
conservatively instead of accidentally (e.g. "zzz" > "2025-11-25"). All
ordering questions go through KNOWN_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS.
