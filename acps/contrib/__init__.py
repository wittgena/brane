# acps.contrib.__init__
"""
Experimental helpers for Agent Client Protocol integrations.

Everything exposed from :mod:`acp.contrib` is considered unstable and may change
without notice. These modules are published to share techniques observed in the
reference implementations (for example Toad or kimi-cli) while we continue
refining the core SDK surface.

The helpers live in ``acp.contrib`` so consuming applications must opt-in
explicitly, making it clear that the APIs are incubating.
