"""Transport-specific metadata attached to each inbound message.

`TransportContext` is the base; each transport defines its own subclass with
whatever fields make sense (HTTP request id, ASGI scope, stdio process handle,
etc.). The dispatcher passes it through opaquely; only the layers above the
dispatcher (`ServerRunner`, `Context`, user handlers) read its concrete fields.
